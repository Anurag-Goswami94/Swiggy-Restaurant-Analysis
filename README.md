Analysis-6: Investigate the relationship between restaurant price and rating.
	While analysing the relationship between restaurant prices and average ratings, we found out that the restaurant prices does impact the average ratings but the impact is very weak. Meaning that when the price increases, there is a slight tendency for the average rating to increase as well. It is because the other factors are also important to be considered to determine the average rating.  

Recommendations: - 
1>	As the top 3 areas of all the 9 cities of India are famous for combination of factors like central location, variety in food types, and affordability. Swiggy could deploy more Delivery Agents in these areas of the cities so that they are able handle a greater number of orders coming from these areas. After doing so, the waiting time of the customers in getting the delivery will decrease and the customer will prefer to make most of the orders from these areas through Swiggy which will give Swiggy a good business.

2>	The restaurants owners of the low rated restaurants should focus on increasing the quality of their restaurants which will improve customer experience leading to good rating. It is because as per our analysis we can see that the impact of Price is very less over the rating, so concentrating on increasing the quality will help to get good rating.


3>	Swiggy can suggest the restaurant owners who are serving the popular foods types in the city to keep offers on these types of foods which will help in promotion of the food and restaurant and will attract more customers. This will give a boost to the sales of these restaurants through Swiggy and doing this the Swiggy Delivery Agent and Swiggy can earn good commission.
